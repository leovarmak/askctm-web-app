<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering was first started with an aim to provide quality engineers not only to our nation but also to other countries. The Mechanical Engineering field of study includes technical subject areas such as thermal engineering, design, manufacturing, materials sciences, CAD/CAM etc. Mechanical Engineers are people with a pragmatic ability to design, model physical systems, to analyze and create; all within the framework of socio-humanistic needs. The mechanical engineer is a concerned individual.</p>

<p>The strength of our department is derived from its excellent faculty, the comprehensive facilities and the success of our graduates in the market. The faculty members of the department are a combination of both high qualification and experience (industrial and academic).Many of our faculty are highly recognized in their fields and have earned good name and fame in teaching. Our students are provided a solid engineering education with a focus on creativity and innovation and a strong ethical responsibility. The mechanical engineering program prepares graduates with strong leadership qualities. These leadership qualities and our program&#39;s high technical standards generate strong interest from industries and employers across the region.</p>

<p>On the research side the department is actively engaged in research in the areas of Heat Transfer, Machine Design, Industrial Engineering and Manufacturing.</p>

<h3>VISION</h3>

<p>The Mechanical Engineering Department endeavors to be recognized globally for outstanding education and research leading to well qualified engineers, who are innovative, entrepreneurial and successful in advanced fields of mechanical engineering to cater the ever changing industrial demands and social needs.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>MISSION</h3>

<ol>
<li> To imparting highest quality education to the students to build their capacity and enhancing their skills to make them globally competitive mechanical engineers.</li>
<li> To maintaining state of the art research facilities to provide collaborative environment that stimulates faculty, staff and students with opportunities to create, analyze, apply and disseminate knowledge.</li>
<li> To develop alliances with world class R&amp;D organizations, educational institutions, industry and alumni for excellence in teaching, research and consultancy practices.</li>
<li> To provide the students with academic environment of excellence, leadership, ethical guidelines and lifelong learning needed for a long productive career.</li>
